Follow on from Calling_Dallas_multibus - The temperature of a location is largely determined by the moisture content of the air. 
Knowing the humidity can help to compare times taken and therefore wood required to heat an area and/or dry clothes. 
Wet clothes refuse to dry in an already high in humidity. Having data to back this up will help.
- In addition when air seasoning wood, the drying can be the most important. e.g sizeable, dead hardwood, ready for burning, but for the accumulated moisture from being left in the woods.
- Hand splitting large sections is hindered by large moisture content. Data will be interesting and useful.
